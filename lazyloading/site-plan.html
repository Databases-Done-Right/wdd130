      <p><b>Importance of Website Speed</b><br>
Over the years there has been an ever-increasing focus on getting a website to load as fast as possible. Today’s internet users expect to be able to find the information they are looking for nearly instantaneously. If they aren’t able to access their desired information within seconds, they are very likely to leave and go elsewhere. In fact “53% of mobile visitors leave if a website takes more than 3 seconds to load” Dainial An, Google, <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-ca/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/" target="_blank">2017</a>. You can see that having a website load as quickly as possible is paramount to not only landing new business but for customer retention as well. 
</p><p><b>Search Engines and Site Speed</b>
Not only do site users want things to load quickly, but so do the search engines as well. Search engines care not only about providing relative content with respect to the search query, but they also want to provide a good user experience and reward websites that load quickly as that helps keep users happy. This coupled with the fact that mobile internet use, and the limited bandwidth that comes with it, is on the rise. Having a website load lightning-fast is paramount to ranking well within the search engine results pages (SERPs). The result is that companies are continually striving to find ways to speed up how fast their websites load. Enter lazy loading images.

      </ul>
      <h3>Lazy Loading Images</h3>
      <p>
        <b>What is Lazy Loading?</b>
        <br>Lazy loading allows a website to load faster as only the images that are currently on screen (within the browser viewport) are fetched when the page initially loads. The rest of the site imagery is passively loaded as a user scrolls up and down and the respective images are scrolled into view.
        </p><p><b>Why worry about a website’s images?</b>
        <br>Because <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/page-weight#:~:text=Unoptimized%20images%20are%20often%20the,of%20the%20total%20page%20weight.">approximately 75%</a> of a website’s size is made up of site images, a great focus needs to be placed on reducing the size of those images wherever possible. By optimizing the way size and method that website imagery is loaded, the overall size of a website can be reduced and a website is able to be rendered faster.
        </p><p><b>How lazy loading works</b>
        <br>Lazy loading site imagery works by taking altering the “img” tags of a website’s HTML so that the image source is removed when the site is initially served up to the client’s browser. Because the structural elements of a webpage are all contained within the text portion, this allows the browser to render sooner. A site JavaScript then tells the browser to go and fetch just the images that are currently within the page viewport. Because the viewable portion of a webpage is usually a fraction of the full page this allows the user to interact with the site sooner. Lazy loading does not end there, the script continues to load website content as a user scrolls up or down the page and loads the needed images just prior to that new section of a page is scrolled into view. Another benefit of lazy loading images is that because many users don’t scroll down a webpage much past what is known as the “above the fold” line, server resources are conserved as unviewed site imagery never had to be fetched.

      <h3>Benefits of Lazy Loading Images</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Benefits of Optimized Site Imagery</b>
<br>The result of a website that utilizes lazy loading images is a webpage that presents a page that a user can interact with sooner, thereby increasing user satisfaction. Server resources are conserved allowing the server to handle page requests quicker further adding to a benefit to page load time. Also, let’s not forget the benefits afforded to a website that loads quickly from a search engine standpoint. Because your website loads quickly and is serving up an optimized user experience, search engines will rank the site higher within their results which leads to an increase in traffic, as well as an increase in new customers.
