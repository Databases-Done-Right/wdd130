      <h1>Importance of Website Speed</h1>
      <p>Over the years there has been an ever-increasing focus on getting a website to load as fast as possible. Today’s internet users expect to be able to find the information they are looking for nearly instantaneously. If they aren’t able to access their desired information within seconds, they are very likely to leave and go elsewhere. In fact “53% of mobile visitors leave if a website takes more than 3 seconds to load” Dainial An, Google, <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-ca/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/" target="_blank">2017</a>.

      <p><b>Search Engines and Site Speed</b> - Not only do site users want things to load quickly, but so do the search engines as well. Search engines care not only about providing relative content with respect to the search query, but they also want to provide a good user experience and reward websites that load quickly as that helps keep users happy. This coupled with the fact that mobile internet use, and the limited bandwidth that comes with it, is on the rise. Having a website load lightning-fast is paramount to ranking well within the search engine results pages (SERPs). The result is that companies are continually striving to find ways to speed up how fast their websites load. Enter lazy loading images.</p>
